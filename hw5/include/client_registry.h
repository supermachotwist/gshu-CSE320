 * A client registry keeps track of the clients that are currently connected.
 * Each time a client connects, a new CLIENT object is created and added to
 * the registry.  When the thread servicing a client is about to terminate,
 * it removes the CLIENT object from the registry.  The client registry also
 * provides a function for shutting down all client connections and a function
 * that can be called by a thread that wishes to wait for the client count to
 * drop to zero.  Such a function is useful, for example, in order to achieve
 * clean server termination: when termination is desired, the "main" thread
 * will shut down all client connections and then wait for the set of registered
 * clients become empty before exiting the program.
