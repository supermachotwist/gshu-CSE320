 * This function executes a "service loop" that receives packets from
 * the client and dispatches to appropriate functions to carry out
 * the client's requests.  It also maintains information about whether
 * the client has logged in or not.  Until the client has logged in,
 * only LOGIN packets will be honored.  Once a client has logged in,
 * LOGIN packets will no longer be honored, but other packets will be.
 * The service loop ends when the network connection shuts down and
 * EOF is seen.  This could occur either as a result of the client
 * explicitly closing the connection, a timeout in the network causing
 * the connection to be closed, or the main thread of the server shutting
 * down the connection as part of graceful termination.
