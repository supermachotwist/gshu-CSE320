/**
 * DTMF generation main function.
 * DTMF events are read (in textual tab-separated format) from the specified
 * input stream and audio data of a specified duration is written to the specified
 * output stream.  The DTMF events must be non-overlapping, in increasing order of
 * start index, and must lie completely within the specified duration.
 * The sample produced at a particular index will either be zero, if the index
 * does not lie between the start and end index of one of the DTMF events, or else
 * it will be a synthesized sample of the DTMF tone corresponding to the event in
 * which the index lies.
 *
 *  @param events_in  Stream from which to read DTMF events.
 *  @param audio_out  Stream to which to write audio header and sample data.
 *  @param length  Number of audio samples to be written.
 *  @return 0 if the header and specified number of samples are written successfully,
 *  EOF otherwise.

/**
 * DTMF detection main function.
 * This function first reads and validates an audio header from the specified input stream.
 * The value in the data size field of the header is ignored, as is any annotation data that
 * might occur after the header.
 *
 * This function then reads audio sample data from the input stream, partititions the audio samples
 * into successive blocks of block_size samples, and for each block determines whether or not
 * a DTMF tone is present in that block.  When a DTMF tone is detected in a block, the starting index
 * of that block is recorded as the beginning of a "DTMF event".  As long as the same DTMF tone is
 * present in subsequent blocks, the duration of the current DTMF event is extended.  As soon as a
 * block is encountered in which the same DTMF tone is not present, either because no DTMF tone is
 * present in that block or a different tone is present, then the starting index of that block
 * is recorded as the ending index of the current DTMF event.  If the duration of the now-completed
 * DTMF event is greater than or equal to MIN_DTMF_DURATION, then a line of text representing
 * this DTMF event in tab-separated format is emitted to the output stream. If the duration of the
 * DTMF event is less that MIN_DTMF_DURATION, then the event is discarded and nothing is emitted
 * to the output stream.  When the end of audio input is reached, then the total number of samples
 * read is used as the ending index of any current DTMF event and this final event is emitted
 * if its length is at least MIN_DTMF_DURATION.
 *
 *   @param audio_in  Input stream from which to read audio header and sample data.
 *   @param events_out  Output stream to which DTMF events are to be written.
 *   @return 0  If reading of audio and writing of DTMF events is sucessful, EOF otherwise.
